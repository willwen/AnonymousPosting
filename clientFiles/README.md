1) id is set to local storage, and is calcuated from 
function getRandomArbitrary(min, max) {
    return Math.random() * (max - min) + min;
}

2) extra stuff:
xss filtering so input santizing
use bootstrap template
use express for static file servicing

3) whenever you load the page, an ajax request is sent to the server to retreive the list of posts
